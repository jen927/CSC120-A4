- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I think it was very daunting to process. I do think I still have a lot to learn on encapsulation and hope to get more comfortable with it as the semester goes by. After this assignment, I realized that having a rough sketch of the relationships of the different classes and methods helped a lot with deciding private or public. Planning it out also helps visualize how these different decisions affect how my program overall runs. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What really worked was testing each class individually just to see what each method does so when we put it all together in the train class, we can backpeddle and see where it went wrong and in which class. I would really recommend asking questions either on discord or in person. If you don't know where to start, I always look at the previous questions asked on discord to get an idea of where to start. Also, start the assignments earlier or you'll fall way behind.
